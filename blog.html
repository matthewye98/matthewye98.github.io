        <h5>September 27, 2021</h5>
        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>During my time at UMD, specifically when I was on their dining plan, I tried to note down some fun "CP Dining Hacks"
          aka just creative ways to use the foodstuff available in the diner to make something a little more interesting. 2 years post graduation
          and a little boredom/inspiration later, I'm finally publishing it for the next generation (lol). Note that I'm not sure if some or all of
          these items are still even available at the diner(s), but it shouldn't be hard to replicate these. </p>
          <p><b>Milkshake</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Fill cup 1/6 with milk (for coffee flavor, add less milk and a little bit of coffee)</li>
              <li>Fill the cup 2/3 with ice cream (add more or less based on thickness reference)</li>
              <li>Mix vigorously with fork</li>
              <li>Add Oreos</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>Lettuce Noodle chicken bowl</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Obtain a largish bowl</li>
              <li>Place greens on your choice in bowl</li>
              <li>Place noodles of your choice in bowl</li>
              <li>Add some shredded cheese</li>
              <li>Cut up some chicken and put in bowl</li>
              </li>Mix it all up</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>Waffle + Ice Cream</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Start by making a regular waffle</li>
              <li>You can add other things to the mix as well, (I like chocholate chips)</li>
              <li>Top the waffle with ice cream</li>
              <li>Add any topping you like</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>Cheese on any sandwich</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Go to the sandwich station and ask for JUST cheese</li>
              <li>You can now put it on a chicken sandwich (or anything!)</li>
              <li>To make a Grilled cheese - ask for 3 diff types of cheese then ask them to toas it on some bread</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>Root beer float</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Put soda of choice in cup</li>
              <li>Preferably root beer, doctor pepper, or Pepsi. Anything with strong flavor and carbonation</li>
              <li>Then pour ice cream in the cup to your liking</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>Ice Cream Sundae (personal fav)</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get a small bowl and scoop in some warm brownie</li>
              <li>Then drizzle some chocolate syrup to your liking</li>
              <li>The top with ice cream</li>
              <li>You can add more chocolate or toppings if you like</li>
            </ol>
          <p><b>“Insomnia” ice cream cookie-wich</b></p>
            <ol>
              <li>Get two warm cookies</li>
              <li>Place one cookie on a plate</li>
              <li>Dispense ice cream on top of one cookie, but not so much it overflows</li>
              <li>Place second cookie on top and press down to compact</li>
            </ol>

          <p>Anyways, these are the ones I just happened to write down in my Notes app, I'm positive there's plenty more. Happy dining!</p>

        <div class="blog-body">
          <p>My god has it been a long and tumultuous journey to get here… Not really I’m being dramatic. But anyways, this past semester (Fall 2018), I had made it a goal for myself to build my website and launch a blog from that website.</p>
          <p>This was a lot harder than I imagined. I thought I would just type up some HTML using a premade format and I’d be done with it. Nope. I practically tore my hair out trying to get some of the javascript to work, since I know <em>literally nothing</em> about javascript (or jQuery?). In the end, I did learn a lot and I'm proud of how it all turned out.</p>
          <p>I jumped back and forth between using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap4</a>, a well-established front-end framework, and <a href="https://materializecss.com/">Materialize</a>, a not so well-established, but very cool, front-end framework. I did a little bit of coding in both, but ended up deciding to go with Materialize. I did so for a few reasons.</p>
          <ol>
          <li>It’s based off Google’s <a href="https://material.io/design/">Material Design</a> Philosophy</li>
          <li>I really like Material Design</li>
          <li>It stands out from the crowd a little bit</li>
          </ol>
          <p>I may have done more work than necessary, but that’s rather typical of me. It’s definitely been a learning experience. Oh, and this is also my first blog post. This is <em>also</em> my first time using Markdown to write anything (thanks <a href="https://www.dillinger.io">Dillinger</a> for making it so easy), I guess you could say there’s a lot of firsts going on here. New year, new me! I’m not quite sure what I’m gonna write about in the future, probably some random thoughts that pop in my mind. This might (will) range from nerdy stuff, politics, gaming, rants, LGBTQ+ issues, etc. I hope you stick around!<br>
          Bye. &lt;3</p>
