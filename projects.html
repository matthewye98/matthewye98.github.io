                  <p>Gun violence is extremely prevalent within American schools, places of worship, movie theaters, and general public spaces.
                  As access to guns are relatively easy in the United States, we wanted to bring awareness to the devastation it causes, as well as provide unbiased data so that people can truly learn about the issues.</p>

              <p>

              Food Safety PG, or FSPG for short, is an application that was created in order to guide the general public, and even other groups such as health care administrators and restaurant owners, on the safety and compliance status of food establishments in PG County.

              Hundreds of millions of people are being contaminated by restaurants that are not properly preparing food, causing illnesses and sometimes death, all because there is no clear way for people to know which places are safe to eat in. FSPG is here to change that.

              FSPG is an interactive application that allows users to explore the different food establishments around the area and learn more about their cleanliness rating and how well they did in previous inspections. Because of its transparent and unbiased presentation of the data, users will be able to make more well-informed decisions on where to eat, making sure their health is their number one priority.
              </p>


              <h3>How it works</h3>
              <p> You’re hungry and you want to eat… what do you do.</p>

              <ol>

                  <div class="col l6">

                  <li>The first step in using the FSPG application is applying the filters that relate to your specific search.
                    This can be done by checking the relevant boxes on the left hand side under the Filters section, and clicking “Filter”.</li>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col l6">

                  </div>


                  <div class="col l5">
                  <li>You’ll notice that the map has updated with markers of the locations of food establishments that meet the criteria of the filters that you selected.
                    Click on the marker you want to learn more about and then click “Get Results” to learn more about the food establishment.</li>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col l7">
                    <img class="img-fluid" src=assets/fpsg/map.png>

                  </div>


                  <div class="col l5">
                  <li>Underneath, you’ll see that the name, location, & inspection results in the 'Results' section of the page
                    have updated with the information related to the food establishment that you have selected.</li>
                  </div>
                  <div class="col l7">
                    <img class="img-fluid" src=assets/fpsg/results.png>

                  </div>


              </ol>

              </p>
              In just three simple steps you've gotten that much closer to finding out which food establishments meet health standards that make food safe to eat :)

              also, Human Cented Design. We sought out to tackle the ongoing problem of food waste on the University of Maryland campus. </blockquote>

              <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
              <p>The University of Maryland needs to redistribute food ‘waste’ to the community in a way that is sustainable. This project will support the University of Maryland school system initiative to underserved individuals in the College Park area. As a student body, we have the capability to not only reduce our environmental footprint, but also serve the outside community. In order to fulfill our goals, we must create a means of communication between the community outside and within the University of Maryland. </p>
